title: "Soybeans Pin in R - Write"
output: html_document
---

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(pins)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, paged.print = FALSE)
```


In this R markdown document we write a pin to Connect.  The pin consists of historical soybean yields. 

### Reading and Wrangling Data

We begin by reading the full crop yields data set and then filtering it for soybeans.
```{r}
df <- read_csv("crop_yields.csv", show_col_types = FALSE)
df <- df %>% filter(product == "soybeans") %>% drop_na()
df
```


### Creating the Board

The next step in writing a pin is creating a board, which is essentially a connection to the Connect server.  In order to do this you need to set the `CONNECT_SERVER` and `CONNECT_API_KEY` environment variables in the `.Renviron` file.
```{r}
board <- board_connect(auth = "envvar")
```


### Writing the Pin

To write the pin, we use the `pins::pin_write()` function.
```{r}
board %>% pin_write(df, "pritam.dalal/soybean_yields_pin", type= "csv")
```
