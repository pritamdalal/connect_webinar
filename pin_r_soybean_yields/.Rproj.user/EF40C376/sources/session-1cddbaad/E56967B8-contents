title: "Soybeans Pin in R - Read"
output: html_document

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(pins)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, paged.print = FALSE)
```


In this R markdown document we read from a pin hosted on Connect.  The pin is a data set consisting of historical soybean yields.


### Creating the Board

The first step to reading a pin is creating a board, which is essentially a connection to the Connect server.  In order to do this you need to set the `CONNECT_SERVER` and `CONNECT_API_KEY` environment variables in the `.Renviron` file.
```{r}
board <- board_rsconnect(auth = "envvar")
```


### Reading the Pin

Next, to read the pin we use the `pins::pin_read()` function.
```{r}
df <- board %>% pin_read("pritam.dalal/soybean_yields_pin") %>% tibble()
df
```

### Visualizing USA Soybean Yields

Finally let's visualize the history soybean yields for the United States.
```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(entity == "united states") %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = crop_yield)) +
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle("USA Soybean Yields: 1961-2018") +
  xlab("year") +
  ylab("yield")
```
